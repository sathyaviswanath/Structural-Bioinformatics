# **Comparative Structural and Functional Analysis Report**

## **1. Model Selection based on Quality Validation**

For comparative and structural analysis, the first essential step is to select protein models with reliable structural quality. Validation was performed using Ramachandran plots, G-factor assessments and VERIFY3D scores.

### Based on these validations:

- The Apolipoprotein, Amyloid beta precursor protein and Beta secretase models demonstrated strong backbone geometry (>90% residues in most favoured Ramachandran regions), acceptable G-factor values, and passed the VERIFY3D profile, indicating reliable structural integrity and accurate residue environments.

- The Beclin and Tau models, while showing reasonably good backbone geometry, failed VERIFY3D validation, signifying possible issues with atomic environments and overall fold accuracy.

**Therefore for subsequent detailed structural and comparative analysis, the Apolipoprotein, Amyloid beta precursor protein and Beta secretase models were prioritized while Beclin and Tau protein models were included with caution due to their limitations revealed by validation scores.**
