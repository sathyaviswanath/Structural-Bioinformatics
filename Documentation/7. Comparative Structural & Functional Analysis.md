# **Comparative Structural & Functional Analysis of five proteins in ChimeraX**

## Objective
The objective of this final step is to perform a **detailed structural and functional comparison** between the **predicted 3D protein models** and their corresponding **experimentally resolved structures** obtained from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). This analysis aims to evaluate the **accuracy, structural integrity, and functional relevance** of the predicted models generated in earlier steps of the project.

## Input Data
- Predicted protein structures generated using **SWISS-MODEL**
- Experimentally determined protein structures retrieved from **RCSB Protein Data Bank**
- Validated models (from Ramachandran plot and Verify3D analysis)

## Software Used
- **UCSF ChimeraX (v1.11)**
- Clustal Omega (via ChimeraX web services)
- UniProt annotations integrated within ChimeraX

## Methodology

### 1. Structure Loading and Preparation
- Predicted and known protein structures were loaded into UCSF ChimeraX using the `open` command.
- Chains corresponding to homologous regions were selected for comparison.
- Secondary structure was computed for both models prior to alignment.

### 2. Sequence-Based Alignment
- Pairwise sequence alignment was performed using: `sequence align` command.
- Conserved regions were inspected to ensure correct residue correspondence before structural superposition.

### 3. Structural Superposition
- Structural alignment was performed using: `matchmaker` command.
- Backbone-based alignment with BLOSUM62 substitution matrix was applied.
- Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) values were calculated to quantify structural similarity.

### 4. Visualization and Analysis
- Predicted and known structures were color-coded for clear distinction.
- Structural overlap, conformational differences, and domain-level similarity were visually examined.
- Functional regions and conserved motifs were inspected using Uniprot annotations and also manually.
- H bonds are also found in the functional region.
- High-resolution images were captured using the `save` command for documentation.

## Methods Justification
- Structural similarity between predicted and experimentally resolved protein structures was assessed using UCSF ChimeraX through structure-based superposition performed with the MatchMaker tool.
- Quantitative evaluation was carried out using Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) values, while qualitative assessment involved visual inspection of backbone alignment and secondary structure overlap.
- Functional region conservation was evaluated by examining the spatial alignment of known functional domains and key residues annotated from UniProt and PDB records.
- Structural deviations were interpreted in the context of protein flexibility, intrinsic disorder, and experimental resolution.
- Key observations summarize whether observed differences are confined to flexible regions or have potential functional implications.
