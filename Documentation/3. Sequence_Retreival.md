# **Selected Protein Targets of Alzheimer's Disease**

1. Amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP), 
2. Tau protein (MAPT), 
3. Beta-secretase 1 (BACE1), 
4. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) and 
5. Beclin-1 (BECN1)

## **Retreival of Protein Sequences**

- The amino acid sequences for the selected Alzheimer's disease protein targets were retrieved from reliable public databases, 
   
    - **UniProt (https://www.uniprot.org)**

-  For each protein, the UniProt accession numbers were noted to ensure traceability. 

- The full-length sequences were downloaded in FASTA format and carefully verified for completeness by cross-checking sequence lengths and annotations against database records. 

- Any ambiguous or partial sequences were excluded to maintain data quality. 

- This rigorous retrieval process provided standardized and accurate protein sequences as inputs for further bioinformatics analysis such as structural prediction and homology modeling.
