# **Alzheimer's Disease (AD)**
- **Alzheimer’s disease (AD)** is a **chronic neurodegenerative disorder** and the leading cause of dementia in aging populations worldwide. 
- It is characterized by progressive memory impairment, cognitive dysfunction, behavioral changes, and ultimately loss of bodily functions. 
- **Pathologically, AD is marked by two main features in the brain:** Extracellular amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaques and Intracellular neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated tau protein. 
- These protein aggregates disrupt neural communication and trigger neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, synaptic dysfunction, and neuronal death. 
- The etiology of AD involves genetic risk factors (e.g., ApoE4 allele), environmental influences, and cellular mechanisms such as impaired protein clearance and mitochondrial dysfunction. 
- Early diagnosis and effective treatment remain challenging, underscoring the need for detailed structural and functional studies of critical protein targets.

# **Selected Proteins Details**

## **Amyloid-beta (Aβ) precursor protein (APP):**

**Type:** Transmembrane glycoprotein

**Function:** APP is involved in normal neuronal growth, survival, and synaptic formation.

**Role in AD:** Cleaved by BACE1 and gamma-secretase to produce Aβ peptides; abnormal accumulation forms amyloid plaques toxic to neurons.

## **Tau protein (MAPT):**

**Type:** Microtubule-associated protein

**Function:** Stabilizes microtubules in neurons, crucial for intracellular transport.

**Role in AD:** Hyperphosphorylation causes tau to detach from microtubules and aggregate into neurofibrillary tangles, impairing neuronal integrity. These tangles disrupt neuronal function and contribute to cell death.

## **Beta-secretase 1 (BACE1):**

**Type:** Aspartyl protease enzyme

**Function:** Initiates cleavage of APP to release amyloid-beta peptides.

**Role in AD:** Elevated BACE1 activity drives increased amyloid-beta production and plaque formation.

## **Apolipoprotein E (ApoE):**

**Type:** Lipoprotein involved in lipid transport (cholesterol transport and neuronal repair)

**Function:** Mediates lipid metabolism, neuronal repair, and amyloid-beta clearance.

**Role in AD:** ApoE4 variant impairs amyloid-beta clearance and promotes aggregation, increasing AD risk.

## **Beclin-1 (BECN1):**

**Type:** Autophagy-related protein

**Function:** Key regulator of autophagy, a cellular degradation and recycling pathway.

**Role in AD:** Reduced Beclin-1 impairs clearance of toxic protein aggregates, exacerbating amyloid-beta and tau accumulation.
