This project focuses on key protein targets involved in Alzheimer's disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by memory loss and cognitive decline. 
- The selected proteins,
    1. Amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP), 
    2. Tau protein (MAPT), 
    3. Beta-secretase 1 (BACE1), 
    4. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) and 
    5. Beclin-1 (BECN1) — play central roles in AD pathology through processes like amyloid plaque formation, tau tangle development, lipid metabolism, and impaired autophagy. 
- This study involves retrieval and analysis of their sequences, along with prediction and validation of their secondary and tertiary structures, aiming to better understand their function and interaction in AD for potential therapeutic targeting.
