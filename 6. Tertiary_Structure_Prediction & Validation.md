# **Tertiary Structure Prediction & Validation Report**

## **Purpose of the Tertiary Structure Analysis of Proteins**

- The purpose of homology modeling in protein structure prediction is to predict the three-dimensional (3D) structure of a protein whose experimental structure is unknown by using the known 3D structure of a related homologous protein (template). 

- The underlying principle is that protein tertiary structure is more conserved than amino acid sequence, so proteins with similar sequences tend to have similar structures. 

- This makes homology modeling a reliable and widely used computational method to generate structural models when experimental methods like X-ray crystallography or NMR are unavailable or difficult to apply.

## **Purpose of Validation of Predicted Results**

- Validation of homology models using tools like ProCheck and Verify3D serves to assess the quality and reliability of the predicted structures. 

- ProCheck evaluates stereochemical quality through parameters like Ramachandran plots showing favored and disallowed residue regions, while Verify3D assesses how compatible the 3D atomic model is with the original amino acid sequence. 

- Validation ensures that the modeled structure is geometrically reasonable and biologically meaningful, guiding further refinement for downstream applications such as function prediction, drug design, or molecular docking.

## **Methods**

## Homology Modeling

- **Tool:** Swiss-Model
- **Template Selection:** Based on sequence similarity
- **Modeling Protocol:** Involves four main steps - Identifying structural templates using BLAST or HHblits, Aligning the target sequence with the template(s), Building the 3D model through a rigid fragment assembly method and Evaluating the model's quality using the QMEAN score

## Validation

- **ProCheck:** Used to assess stereochemical quality (Ramachandran plots)
- **Verify3D:** Used to evaluate compatibility between 3D structure and sequence
